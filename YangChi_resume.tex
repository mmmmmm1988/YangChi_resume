	\section{RESEARCH WORKS}
	\begin{description}
		\item[Network Coding in Multi-Radio Networks:] 
			Design and implement an opportunistic and independent 2.5 layer protocol for network coding in multi-radio networks. First distributed and practical solution to this problem. Throughput gain in some cases can be 10\%. Latency gain around 50\% is also achieved. \\
			\textbf{Source code of Yanci, in C++, my implementation of COPE: \url{https://github.com/yangchi/ns3-yanci}} \\
			\textbf{Source code Murco in C++: \url{https://github.com/yangchi/Murco}} \\
			Publication: \emph{Murco: An Opportunistic Network Coding Framework in Multi-Radio Networks, IEEE ICC 2012, first author}
		\item[Practical Coding-Aware Routing Protocols:] 
			Propose and design a new routing metric ETOX and a hybrid routing protocol HyCare for network coding capable networks. ETOX consider both coding opportunities and wireless channel quality. HyCare has both link-state routing and reverse forwarding functions. Achieve around 100\% throughput gain compared to classical routing protocols with network coding in wireless mesh network backbone.\\
			\textbf{Source code in C++: \url{https://github.com/yangchi/ns3-ETOX} } \\
			Publication: \emph{HyCare: Hybrid Coding-Aware Routing with ETOX Metric in Multi-hop Wireless Networks, to appear at IEEE MASS 2013, first author}
		\item[Network Locality in Wireless Networks:] 
			This is the first validation of network locality in both WLAN and wireless mesh networks. Created packet parser in \textbf{Python} to analyze more than 1.3 billion packets (more than 130GB of data) collected from both real network traces and simulations. Examined 4 common network locality characteristics with 5 different routing schemes in multi-hop wireless networks.\\
			\textbf{Source code in Python: \url{https://bitbucket.org/yangchi/trace_parser} } \\
			Publication: \emph{Network Locality in Wireless Networks, ACS/IEEE AICCSA 2013, first author}
		\item [Decoding-Delay Sensitive Coding Scheme in TCP:]
			On-going project. Designing a novel coding scheme for network-coded TCP to solve the decoding delay problem in such TCP implementations. This one will be implemented in Linux kernel 3.6 and the experiment will be carried on in a Raspberry-pi based wireless testbed.
