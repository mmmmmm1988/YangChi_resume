##EXPERIENCE

**12/2013 - Present**: Software Engineer, Cisco Systems

I work in the Core Software Group (CSG) at Cisco. Specifically I work on network policy infra across many platforms on Cisco IOS systems. Some interesting works that I contributed:

(1) Code convergence of the network policy infra between two major branches of Cisco IOS systems.

(2) WPM (Wireless Provisioning Module): A event-driven module sits in-between wireless controller and policy infra to help applying dynamic policies onto wireless entities like AP, radio and clients.

(3) Non-unique class ID in the policy infra to support non-unique priority levels in OpenFlow.

(4) Network policy statistics: This is a small one. Just used an AVL tree to count and update policy types and client types, for the speed.

##PAST RESEARCH WORKS

###Network Coding in Multi-Radio Networks: 

**Source code of Yanci, in C++, my implementation of COPE: [https://github.com/yangchi/ns3-yanci](https://github.com/yangchi/ns3-yanci)**

**Source code Murco in C++: [https://github.com/yangchi/Murco](https://github.com/yangchi/Murco)**

Design and implement an opportunistic and independent 2.5 layer protocol for network coding in multi-radio networks. First distributed and practical solution to this problem. Throughput gain in some cases can be 10%. Latency gain around 50% is also achieved.

Publication: *Murco: An Opportunistic Network Coding Framework in Multi-Radio Networks, IEEE ICC 2012, first author*

###Practical Coding-Aware Routing Protocols:

**Source code in C++: [https://github.com/yangchi/ns3-ETOX](https://github.com/yangchi/ns3-ETOX)**

Propose and design a new routing metric ETOX and a hybrid routing protocol HyCare for network coding capable networks. ETOX consider both coding opportunities and wireless channel quality. HyCare has both link-state routing and reverse forwarding functions. Achieve around 100% throughput gain compared to classical routing protocols with network coding in wireless mesh network backbone.

Publication: *HyCare: Hybrid Coding-Aware Routing with ETOX Metric in Multi-hop Wireless Networks, to appear at IEEE MASS 2013, first author*

###Network Locality in Wireless Networks:

**Source code in Python: [https://bitbucket.org/yangchi/trace_parser](https://bitbucket.org/yangchi/trace_parser)**

This is the first validation of network locality in both WLAN and wireless mesh networks. Created packet parser in **Python** to analyze more than 1.3 billion packets (more than 130GB of data) collected from both real network traces and simulations. Examined 4 common network locality characteristics with 5 different routing schemes in multi-hop wireless networks.

Publication: *Network Locality in Wireless Networks, ACS/IEEE AICCSA 2013, first author*

###Decoding-Delay Sensitive Coding Scheme in TCP:

On-going project. Designing a novel coding scheme for network-coded TCP to solve the decoding delay problem in such TCP implementations. This one will be implemented in Linux kernel 3.6 and the experiment will be carried on in a Raspberry-pi based wireless testbed.
